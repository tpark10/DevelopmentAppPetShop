App.js: 
Deals with the creation of the initial productList (buying options for the pet-shop). Then, that list is passed
into FilteredList.js as a prop for further manipulation. 

FilteredList.js:
Deals with most logic in this project. Deals with the two filters (pet type, pet exotic level), one sort 
(price), and the cart aggregator. The productList is passed again into the DisplayList.js to actually 
render visible componenets on the react-app. 

DisplayList.js:
Deals with rendering components such as cards and the cardgrid into the react-app. Sorting is put into action 
here after the filters, so that the filters and sort can work simultaneously. 

Cart.js: 
Deals with the displaying of the cart on the right hand of the react-app where the filteredlist with the card 
options are on the left.
